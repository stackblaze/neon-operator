              APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.
              Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and
              may reject unrecognized values.

                description: |-
                  AutoScale enables automatic scaling of compute instances to zero when idle.
                  When enabled, compute instances will scale down to 0 replicas after being idle
                  for the duration specified by SuspendTimeoutSeconds.

              parentBranchID:
                description: |-
                  ParentBranchID specifies the name of the parent branch to branch from.
                  If set, the new branch will be created from this parent branch's timeline.
                  Mutually exclusive with creating a bootstrap branch (when not set, creates a new bootstrap branch).

              parentLSN:
                description: |-
                  ParentLSN specifies a specific LSN (Log Sequence Number) to branch from.
                  If set along with ParentBranchID, the new branch will be created from the parent branch
                  at this specific LSN. Mutually exclusive with ParentTimestamp (if both are set, ParentLSN takes precedence).
                type: string
              parentTimestamp:
                description: |-
                  ParentTimestamp specifies an RFC3339 timestamp for point-in-time branching.
                  If set along with ParentBranchID, the new branch will be created from the parent branch
                  at the specified point in time. The timestamp will be converted to an LSN automatically.
                type: string
              pgVersion:
                description: |-
                  PGVersion specifies the PostgreSQL version to use for the branch.

                  SuspendTimeoutSeconds specifies the number of seconds of inactivity before
                  a compute instance is suspended. A value of -1 disables auto-suspend.
                  Only used when AutoScale is enabled.
